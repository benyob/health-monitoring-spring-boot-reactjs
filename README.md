such as viewing charts of your health data for example
blood pressure ,sugar levels and so forth , you will have
access to a broad view of your well being,and this in turn can immensely help you avoid some illnesses in the future.The app will also notify you whenever there is some potential health issues that you might encounter later on, and will give you some advise on how to avoid or solve them,so In the long run this can reduce the overall health costs.
